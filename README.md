# Correction_of_anticrossings_frozen_phonon
The article 'Frozen-phonon method for state anticrossing situations and its application to zero-point motion  effects in diamondoids' shows that frozen-phonon calculations of  renormalizations of electronic eigenvalues (due to electron-vibrational interaction) present errors due to the anticrossing of electronic states. The code stored in this repository calculates the corrected renormalizations, which avoid the mentioned distorting effect. This also include pdf files with tutorials on how to use this code.
